# Project 3 - *Instagram*

**Instagram** is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **18** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- User can log in and log out of his or her account
- The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"

- [ ] User can load more posts once he or she reaches the bottom of the feed using infinite scrolling
- Show the username and creation time for each post

- User Profiles:
  - [ ] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
  - [ ] Display the profile photo with each post
  - [ ] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse

- [ ] User can like a post and see number of likes for each post in the post details screen
