# Project 3 - *Instagram*

**Instagram** is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **18** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- User can log in and log out of his or her account
- The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- User can pull to refresh the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- User can tap a post to view post details, including timestamp and caption

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- Run your app on your phone and use the camera to take the photo
- Show the username and creation time for each post
- User can use a Tab Bar to switch between a Home Feed tab (all posts) and a Profile tab (only posts published by the current user)
- User Profiles:
  - Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
  - Display the profile photo with each post
- Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Parse queries
2. PFImageView
